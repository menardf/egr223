In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him, and he with me.
Therefore, if anyone is in Christ he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!
